<h1>This is an informational website about the game Rain World</h1>

<p>In this website I will be explaining all h=my favourite aspects of the game and why I like it so much</p>

<h3>I hope this helps you decide wether to get it or not.</h3>

<p>Rain World is a very fun steam game, which does the best job at recreating an eco system.<br>
This means that the game is still playing even if it's off screen. Which is a really cool concept.</p>

<p>With the amount of unique creatures and the huge AI it uses to keep track is crazy. It also somehow doesn't lag,<br> what is very impressive for how big one region is.<br> This gaurenties that everytime you wake up, the cycle will be different, since all the enemies will be randomly around the map.</p>
