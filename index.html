<h1>Rain World</h1>

<p>In this website I will be explaining all my favourite aspects of Rain World and why I like it so much.<br>
Rain World is a very unique steam game. which does a very job at re-creating an eco system.<br>
This means that the game is still playing even if it's off screen. Which is a really cool concept.</p>

<p>With the amount of unique creatures and the huge AI it uses to keep track is crazy. It also somehow doesn't lag, what is very impressive for how big one region is.<br> This guaranties that everytime you wake up, the cycle will be different, since all the other creatures will be randomly around the map.</p>
